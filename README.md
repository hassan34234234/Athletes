Olympic Medal Prediction using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics based on historical data. It follows a full end-to-end machine learning workflow, from hypothesis formulation to model evaluation, using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

📚 Project Overview
Goal: Predict the number of medals a country will win using features like number of athletes and previous medal counts.

Dataset: Historical Summer Olympics data (teams.csv).

Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

🛠️ Key Steps
Hypothesis Formation: Medal counts are predictable using team-level features.

Data Collection: Loaded and explored historical Olympics data.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.

Feature Engineering: Selected numeric features (athletes, previous_medals) for model training.

Model Building: Trained a multivariate Linear Regression model.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE ≈ 3.3 medals).

Analysis: Investigated prediction errors across different countries.

📊 Results
The model performed well for high-participation countries (e.g., USA, Russia).

Accuracy varied for low-participation countries (higher error rates).

Proposed further improvements include:

Adding more features (e.g., event count, athlete-level predictions).

Trying alternative models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x
